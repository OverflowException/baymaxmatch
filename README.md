This project serves as a demo to show how gesture controller works.
     https://github.com/OverflowException/gesture_controller.git
This is a Python 2 project.
You should have Python OpenCV cv2 module installed
Source code is fairly self-explanatory(Python, emmmm...), remember to change IP address and port number where you want this simple little demo to listen for gesture code.
